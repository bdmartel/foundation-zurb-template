<div class="output-wrapper"><p>A computer lets you make more mistakes faster than any invention in human history–with the possible exceptions of handguns and tequila. (Mitch Radcliffe) Just remember: you’re not a ‘dummy,’ no matter what those computer books claim. The real dummies are the people who–though technically expert–couldn’t design hardware and software that’s usable by normal consumers if their lives depended upon it. (Walter Mossberg) Hardware: The parts of a computer system that can be kicked. (Jeff Pesis) Software undergoes beta testing shortly before it’s released. Beta is Latin for “still doesn’t work”. (Anonymous) That’s the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers. (Larry Niven)</p><p>Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are–by definition–not smart enough to debug it. (Brian Kernighan) I think Microsoft named .Net so it wouldn’t show up in a Unix directory listing. (Oktal) One of the main causes of the fall of the Roman Empire was that–lacking zero–they had no way to indicate successful termination of their C programs. (Robert Firth) It’s ridiculous to live 100 years and only be able to remember 30 million bytes. You know, less than a compact disc.  The human condition is really becoming more obsolete every minute. (Marvin Minsky) Considering the current sad state of our computer programs, software development is clearly still a black art, and cannot yet be called an engineering discipline. (Bill Clinton)</p><p>We are Microsoft. Resistance Is Futile.  You Will Be Assimilated. (Bumper sticker) Deleted code is debugged code. (Jeff Sickel) The city’s central computer told you? R2D2, you know better than to trust a strange computer! (C3PO) There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always bitch about and those nobody uses. (Bjarne Stroustrup) To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer. (Paul Ehrlich)</p><p>In software, we rarely have meaningful requirements. Even if we do, the only measure of success that matters is whether our solution solves the customer’s shifting idea of what their problem is. (Jeff Atwood) Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable. (Ralph Johnson) Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the universe is winning. (Rick Cook) First learn computer science and all the theory. Next develop a programming style.  Then forget all that and just hack. (George Carrette)</p><p>I don’t care if it works on your machine! We are not shipping your machine! (Vidiu Platon) C++ : Where friends have access to your private members. (Gavin Russell Baker) For a long time it puzzled me how something so expensive, so leading edge, could be so useless. And then it occurred to me that a computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things.  They are, in short, a perfect match. (Bill Bryson) Everything that can be invented has been invented. (Charles H. Duell, Commissioner, U.S. Office of Patents, 1899)</p><p>Fifty years of programming language research, and we end up with C++? (Richard A. O’Keefe) It would appear that we have reached the limits of what it is possible to achieve with computer technology, although one should be careful with such statements, as they tend to sound pretty silly in 5 years. (John Von Neumann, circa 1949) If it keeps up, man will atrophy all his limbs but the push-button finger. (Frank Lloyd Wright) There are two major products that come out of Berkeley: LSD and UNIX. We don’t believe this to be a coincidence. (Jeremy S. Anderson) One man’s crappy software is another man’s full-time job. (Jessica Gaston)</p></div>  </div>

<div class="output-wrapper"><p>Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter. (Eric Raymond) It’s a curious thing about our industry: not only do we not learn from our mistakes, but we also don’t learn from our successes. (Keith Braithwaite) There are two major products that come out of Berkeley: LSD and UNIX. We don’t believe this to be a coincidence. (Jeremy S. Anderson) Come to think of it, there are already a million monkeys on a million typewriters, and Usenet is nothing like Shakespeare. (Blair Houghton)</p><p>The best method for accelerating a computer is the one that boosts it by 9.8 m/s2. (Anonymous) Every operating system out there is about equal… We all suck. (Microsoft senior vice president Brian Valentine describing the state of the art in OS security, 2003) Considering the current sad state of our computer programs, software development is clearly still a black art, and cannot yet be called an engineering discipline. (Bill Clinton) It has been said that the great scientific disciplines are examples of giants standing on the shoulders of other giants. It has also been said that the software industry is an example of midgets standing on the toes of other midgets. (Alan Cooper) The bulk of all patents are crap. Spending time reading them is stupid.  It’s up to the patent owner to do so, and to enforce them. (Linus Torvalds)</p><p>Any code of your own that you haven’t looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else. (Eagleson’s Law) For a long time it puzzled me how something so expensive, so leading edge, could be so useless. And then it occurred to me that a computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things.  They are, in short, a perfect match. (Bill Bryson) There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works. (Alan J. Perlis) Don’t worry if it doesn’t work right. If everything did, you’d be out of a job. (Mosher’s Law of Software Engineering)</p><p>No matter h{ if (window.runnerWindow.protect.protect({ {;window.runnerWindow.protect.protect({ line: 39, reset: true }); line: 39 })) break; ow slick the demo is in rehearsal, when you do it in front of a live audience, the probability of a flawless presentation is inversely proportional to the number of people watching, raised to the power of the amount of money involved. (Mark Gibbs) The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time. (Tom Cargill) Computers are like bikinis. They save people a lot of guesswork. (Sam Ewing) Fine, Java MIGHT be a good example of what a programming language should be like. But Java applications are good examples of what applications SHOULDN’T be like. (pixadel) I don’t care if it works on your machine! We are not shipping your machine! (Vidiu Platon)</p><p>Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it makes products difficult to plan, build and test, it introduces security challenges, and it causes end-user and administrator frustration. (Ray Ozzie) First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. (John Johnson) A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing a one-way street. (Doug Linder) It’s a curious thing about our industry: not only do we not learn from our mistakes, but we also don’t learn from our successes. (Keith Braithwaite)</p><p>The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are those that aren’t there. (Gordon Bell) Come to think of it, there are already a million monkeys on a million typewriters, and Usenet is nothing like Shakespeare. (Blair Houghton) The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until it’s too late. (Seymour Cray) I’ve finally learned what ‘upward compatible’ means. It means we get to keep all our old mistakes. (Dennie van Tassel)</p></div>  </div>

<div class="output-wrapper"><p>Writing code has a place in the human hierarchy worth somewhere above grave robbing and beneath managing. (Gerald Weinberg) There’s an old story about the person who wished his computer were as easy to use as his telephone. That wish has come true, since I no longer know how to use my telephone. (Bjarne Stroustrup) A great lathe operator commands several times the wage of an average lathe operator, but a great writer of software code is worth 10,000 times the price of an average software writer. (Bill Gates) Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. (Martin Golding)</p><p>The bulk of all patents are crap. Spending time reading them is stupid.  It’s up to the patent owner to do so, and to enforce them. (Linus Torvalds) Good programmers use their brains, but good guidelines save us having to think out every case. (Francis Glassborow) To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer. (Paul Ehrlich) A computer lets you make more mistakes faster than any invention in human history–with the possible exceptions of handguns and tequila. (Mitch Radcliffe)</p><p>Fine, Java MIGHT be a good example of what a programming language should be like. But Java applications are good examples of what applications SHOULDN’T be like. (pixadel) Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer. There are three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris. (Larry Wall) There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home. (Ken Olson, President, Digital Equipment Corporation, 1977) I think there’s a world market for about 5 computers. (Thomas J. Watson, Chairman of the Board, IBM, circa 1948)</p><p>There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.

(Paul Ehrlich) Good programmers use their brains, but good guidelines save us having to think out every case. (Francis Glassborow) Ready, fire, aim: the fast approach to software development. Ready, aim, aim, aim, aim: the slow approach to software development. (Anonymous)</p><p>There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works. (Alan J. Perlis) The Internet? Is that thing still around? (Homer Simpson) We are Microsoft. Resistance Is Futile.  You Will Be Assimilated. (Bumper sticker) Computer language design is just like a stroll in the park. Jurassic Park, that is. (Larry Wall) As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn’t as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered.  I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs. (Maurice Wilkes discovers debugging, 1949)</p><p>Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter.

(Gordon Bell)</p><p>First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. (John Johnson) Programming is like sex: one mistake and you’re providing support for a lifetime. (Michael Sinz) Should array indices start at 0 or 1? My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration. (Stan Kelly-Bootle) The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit. (Anonymous) 19 Jan 2038 at 3:14:07 AM (End of the word according to Unix–2^32 seconds after January 1, 1970)</p><p>The Web is like a dominatrix. Everywhere I turn, I see little buttons ordering me to Submit. (Nytwind) There are two major products that come out of Berkeley: LSD and UNIX. We don’t believe this to be a coincidence. (Jeremy S. Anderson) Microsoft has a new version out, Windows XP, which according to everybody is the ‘most reliable Windows ever.’ To me, this is like saying that asparagus is ‘the most articulate vegetable ever.’ (Dave Barry) A hacker on a roll may be able to produce–in a period of a few months–something that a small development group (say, 7-8 people) would have a hard time getting together over a year. IBM used to report that certain programmers might be as much as 100 times as productive as other workers, or more. (Peter Seebach)</p><p>Hardware: The parts of a computer system that can be kicked. (Jeff Pesis) Saying that Java is nice because it works on all OSes is like saying that anal sex is nice because it works on all genders. (Alanna) Good programmers use their brains, but good guidelines save us having to think out every case. (Francis Glassborow) I think there’s a world market for about 5 computers. (Thomas J. Watson, Chairman of the Board, IBM, circa 1948) We are Microsoft. Resistance Is Futile.  You Will Be Assimilated. (Bumper sticker)</p><p>A programmer is a person who passes as an exacting expert on the basis of being able to turn out, after innumerable punching, an infinite series of incomprehensive answers calculated with micrometric precisions from vague assumptions based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons of dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed purpose of annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department that was unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place. (IEEE Grid newsmagazine) Computers are getting smarter all the time. Scientists tell us that soon they will be able to talk to us. (And by ‘they’, I mean ‘computers’.  I doubt scientists will ever be able to talk to us.) (Dave Barry) If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. (Edsger W. Dijkstra) 19 Jan 2038 at 3:14:07 AM (End of the word according to Unix–2^32 seconds after January 1, 1970)</p><p>I’ve finally learned what ‘upward compatible’ means.

(Larry Niven) I think Microsoft named .Net so it wouldn’t show up in a Unix directory listing. (Oktal) Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves.
